    <p class="start">10 free fire permanent gun skin tips & tricks…</p>
    <div class="tricks">
        <p><b>1.</b> Always open two or more gun crates or boxes at a time. If you open 2 or more gun boxes, your chance will be higher. Do not open a single gun box.</p>
        <p><b>2.</b> If you spin on weapon royale or open gun boxes use Adam as a character and uncheck all the gun skin which you have equipped before.</p>
        <p><b>3.</b> Always try to Spin or open gun boxes after 12 p.m ( Raat ki 12 baaje ki baad).</p>
        <p><b>4.</b> Keep your account clean, that means don’t buy too much top-up in free fire. If you are buying top-up regularly, you are decreasing your chances of getting free gun skin.</p>
        <p><b>5.</b> First day try to open 2 boxes (per day) after 12 p.m for 5 days, then try to open 10 boxes at a time per day. Don’t start with 10 boxes from the first day.</p>
        <p><b>6.</b> Best way to get free gun skin is weapon royale. Spin-on weapon royale as much as possible to get a few permanent gun skin easily. Within 10 spins you can get a minimum of 2 gun skins.</p>
        <p><b>7.</b> If you would like to play with MP40 then stop using that gun for a few days and then spin or open.</p>
        <p><b>8.</b>  Increase your KD rate in free fire which helps you to get free gun skin. Your performance also matters like your total kills, headshots, survival time, global ranking, etc. If you are low on everything you have less chance.</p>
        <p><b>9.</b>  Whenever you are going to open a gun box follow these steps: 1- click on a gun box, 2- click for 30 seconds on a particular gun what you want permanent, 3- then open the box. Same thing you have to do for the weapon royale window.<br>
            <br>Nowadays you can use weapon royal spin to get permanent gun skin. remember weapon royale gun skins are legendary and you have maximum chances to get these skins. but don't go for a top-up rather you can use free weapon royale cards which you have collected from different events.

            Try to collect free weapons that are available in free fire (login tasks, play and win tasks, etc).
           
            Stay connected with free fire, if you quit free fire then you will miss the chance to collect those free weapons.</p>
        <p><b>10.</b> Whenever you get a discount try to buy expensive gun crates like Dragon AK, legendary shotgun, legendary M4A1, etc.</p>
